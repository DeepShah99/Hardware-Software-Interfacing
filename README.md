# Hardware-Software-Interfacing
This course introduces concepts associated with the interface of external hardware to embedded systems and the software control of such hardware.
Topics include bus structures such as I2C, SPI, CAN, parallel and serial interfacing, GPS, and other embedded communications technologies.
Applications involving the design of interfaces and control software for stepper motors, sensing devices, and communications are developed.
